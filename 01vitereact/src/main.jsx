//  MyApp() <- still works, because it is only a function afterall
/* <MyApp /> <- this will also work */
/*reactElement*/ // output showing nothing but full of errors in 'Inpect'
/*ReactElement*/ // I've made the Capital 'R' as we have learnt before but still did not worked !, Again Full of Errors, then what it is the reason - The reason is that the react is expecting me to give it the function so it can parse and do the further process, but as I am giving something which will make it's work easy, I still not get the wanted(joytu hatu) output. One of the reason ye bhi hain ki "proper syntax" me nahi likha hua hain.  just Like "anotherElement", it's written perfectly.

// anotherElement see here I don't need to put "()/parenthesis" or this format "< />" it worked with just it's name !, because it had proper names and syntax.

reactElement // yes with proper syntax and with proper format it Worked ðŸ¥³ !

// {/* <App /> */}
