import Chai from "./chai";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
    <h1>Hello Chai aur React with react</h1>
    <Chai />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;


// here also we need to type the tag "chai" in capital letters like this "Chai", yesss the capital 'C'. Just like in "vite", It is recommended to write the name of the file starting with capital letters like this "Chai.js". the extension can be '.js' or '.js' no need to worry.
